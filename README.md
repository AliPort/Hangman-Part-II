# Hangman-Part-II
Hangman is a game for all ages.
There are 4 categories that will be randomly selected. Guess the word related to the speficic category area in 10 tries or less and win the game. Failure to 
guess the word in 10 tries or less, you lose the game.
For each wrong guess, you'll draw a part of the hangman (head, torso, right arm, left arm, right leg, left leg, and the 4 sides of the box). 
If you struggle with guessing the word, you will be given an option to get a hint. There's only one hint per word. 

Had so much fun that you want to play again? Just click on the button that says "Try Again" and this will reset the game. 

Good luck!
